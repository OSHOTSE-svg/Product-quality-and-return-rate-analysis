Business Overview/Problem
TechTrend Pro faces several significant business challenges, including:

✓ Elevated Return Rates: The company is experiencing higher-than-desired return rates, particularly in the smartphone and laptop product categories. These frequent returns not only impact profitability but also erode customer satisfaction, potentially damaging brand loyalty.
✓ Cost Implications: Handling returns incurs substantial operational costs associated with processing returns, restocking, and providing customer support. These costs are becoming increasingly burdensome.
✓ Lack of Data-Driven Insights: TechTrend Pro lacks a systematic approach to understanding the relationship between product quality and return rates. This hampers the company's ability to make informed decisions regarding product development and sourcing.
✓ Resource Allocation: Inefficiently managing returns consumes valuable resources that could otherwise be directed towards strategic growth and expansion initiatives.
Rationale for the Project
In today's e-commerce and retail industry, the ability to analyze and manage return rates is a critical factor for success. 

Top Five Reasons for Initiating the Project:

✓ Cost Reduction: By reducing return rates through improved product quality, TechTrend Pro can significantly decrease operational costs associated with processing returns, restocking, and customer support.
